Forecasting New York health outcomes using air quality and weather data (2015–2024). This project integrates environmental, meteorological, and public-health data to model and forecast weekly respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes across New York State. The analysis emphasizes both predictive performance and interpretability, bridging traditional statistical modeling with modern machine-learning approaches.

Daily air quality and weather variables were aggregated to a consistent weekly time scale (521 weeks) to align with weekly health indicators, ensuring uniform temporal structure and enabling lag-based analysis. Health outcomes include asthma-related emergency department visits, COPD cases, respiratory ER admissions, influenza-like illness (ILI), and stroke hospital discharges. Environmental exposures include PM₂.₅, ozone, NO₂, CO, SO₂, temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and wind metrics.

The project compares Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) as an interpretable epidemiological baseline against machine-learning models (e.g., CatBoost) capable of capturing nonlinearities and higher-order interactions. Lagged exposures (0–3 weeks), autoregressive terms, and seasonality controls are incorporated to reflect delayed health responses and temporal dependence. Model performance is evaluated using out-of-sample forecasting metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

A central focus of the analysis is the role of pollutant–meteorology interactions and compound exposure effects, including PM₂.₅ × temperature and PM₂.₅ × ozone interactions, which are examined through explicit interaction terms and model-based interpretability tools. In addition, the June 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke episode is treated as a natural experiment, with event-study indicators and structural break tests used to assess whether pollutant–health relationships shifted under extreme exposure conditions.

Results show that smooth seasonal structure and weather-driven trends account for much of the predictable signal in routine forecasting, favoring GAMs for transparency and stability, while machine-learning models provide added value in uncovering nonlinear interaction effects during extreme events. Evidence of statistically significant structural breaks following the 2023 wildfire highlights a potential post-smoke regime shift in environmental health risk.

This repository contains preprocessing workflows, modeling notebooks, analysis outputs, and supporting documentation for a multi-semester honors research project, with future extensions planned in hybrid statistical–ML models, distributed lag nonlinear modeling, and causal inference frameworks for wildfire-related exposure.
